This Privacy Policy explains how AI Browser (“the App”, “we”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects your information. By using the App, you agree to the practices described below.

1. Information We Do Not Collect

AI Browser is designed with user privacy in mind.
✔ We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.
✔ We do not access your device camera, microphone, contacts, files, photos, location, or sensors.
✔ We do not create user accounts and do not ask for login details.

2. Information Processed by the App

While using AI Browser, some information is processed only to provide functionality:

2.1 Browser Content

The App allows users to access websites through a built-in browser.

We do not track, store, or upload your browsing activity.

All browsing data remains on your device and is cleared when the app is closed (unless the OS retains cache).

2.2 AI Interactions (ChatGPT API)

The App uses the OpenAI API to provide AI answers.

Text you type in the AI chat is sent to OpenAI servers for processing.

This data is handled under OpenAI’s Privacy Policy.

AI Browser does not store, log, or reuse this data.

We do not have control over how OpenAI processes or retains API input.

3. Third-Party Services

The App uses the following:

Websites You Visit

Websites opened through the in-app browser may collect data based on their own policies. We recommend reviewing each website’s privacy policy.

4. Children’s Privacy

AI Browser does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. Since no personal data is collected, the app is safe for general use.

5. Security

AI Browser does not store personal information. However, data transmitted to third-party services (like OpenAI or websites you visit) depends on their respective security measures.

6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect new features or legal requirements. Updates will be posted publicly.
